INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• LOW EPR (< 0.3):    High confidence, likely correct answer
• MEDIUM EPR (0.3-0.5): Moderate uncertainty
• HIGH EPR (> 0.5):   High uncertainty, potential hallucination risk
• VERY HIGH EPR (> 0.8): Very uncertain, likely hallucination or wrong answer
